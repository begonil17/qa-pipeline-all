        You are helping build a Turkish QA dataset for an AI assistant.

        You are given main categories. Each category contains focus points.
        A focus point should be treated as a real subtopic, not just loose guidance.

        Categories:
        {json.dumps(categories, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

        For each category:
        - For each focus point, generate exactly {articles_per_focus} useful English Wikipedia article titles.
        - Then generate exactly {extra_articles_per_category} extra category-level article titles that naturally extend the whole category.

        Rules:
        - Focus points are subtopics under the main category.
        - Each focus point must receive its own article candidates.
        - A selected article title should be relevant to its specific focus point.
        - Extra category-level articles should connect to the overall category, not random topics.
        - Prefer mid-level useful topics: not too broad, not too obscure.
        - Prefer stable, factual, non-controversial English Wikipedia pages.
        - Do not duplicate article titles within or across categories.
        - Avoid the listed avoid topics for each category.
        - Avoid controversial politics, religion debates, war/conflict topics, conspiracy theories, adult content, illegal activities, and sensitive medical/legal/financial advice.

        Coverage score guidelines:
        10: Highly useful and directly covers the focus point or category.
        7-9: Important and relevant article.
        4-6: Useful supporting article.
        1-3: Too narrow or weakly relevant.

        For every article title, return:
        - title
        - source_type: "focus" or "category_extra"
        - focus_point: the focus point if source_type is "focus", otherwise null
        - coverage_score
        - reason

        Return ONLY valid JSON.

        Format:

        {{
        "Food and cooking": [
            {{
            "title": "Turkish cuisine",
